# Twitch_IRC_client_bot
Simple irc client/bot for twitch. Also, has the ability of giveaways and check users against a database.

For database support, requires MySQL JDBC Driver

 One I use is from netbeans and is mysql-connector-java-5.1.23-bin.jar


Currently working on:
Cleaning up code in IRCBOT.java in preparation to implement new GUI in /currently_unused/TestSingleFrameLayout.java

Will feature tabs for each channel and also addition menu options/items
